This folder contains test codes. "plr_bayes.exe" and "plr_bayes_freqs.exe" are binary programs compiled with these configurations: windows x86-64 platform, Rust (MSVC), OpenBLAS static linking. To compile on your own, you may need to modify "fan455_bayes_test/Cargo.toml", "fan455_bayes_test/fan455_arrf64/Cargo.toml" and "fan455_bayes_test/fan455_arrf64/build.rs" to use your BLAS and LAPACK libraries. On my computer, MKL runs faster than OpenBLAS. Since MKL does not have an open license, the compiled program in this repository uses OpenBLAS.
