This folder contains test examples. `plr_bayes.exe` and `plr_bayes_freqs.exe` are binary programs compiled with these configurations: windows x86-64 platform, Rust (MSVC), OpenBLAS static linking. 
To compile on your own, you may need to modify `fan455_bayes_test/Cargo.toml`, `fan455_bayes_test/fan455_arrf64/Cargo.toml` and `fan455_bayes_test/fan455_arrf64/build.rs` to use your BLAS and LAPACK libraries. In this repository, `fan455_arrf64` is the only rust crate that requires BLAS/LAPACK libraries, which default to Intel MKL. Another commonly used BLAS/LAPACK library is OpenBLAS. For other BLAS/LAPACK libraries, you need to set their file paths and names in `fan455_bayes_test/fan455_arrf64/build.rs`. On my computer, MKL runs faster than OpenBLAS. But since MKL does not have an open license, the compiled program in this repository uses OpenBLAS. Note that if you use a compiled version of the OpenBLAS library <https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/releases>, you may need to link to "libopenblas.dll" at runtime.
