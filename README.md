This repository contains the Rust and Python codes for the author's working paper "Autocorrelated Errors in Panel Linear Regression A New Objective Bayesian Perspective". It includes an array library `fan455_arrf64` and a Rust implementation of [Stan NUTS](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan), which are written as flexible as possible to be used for other numerical and statistical works. Test examples are in the `examples` folder that users on 64-bit Windows can directly run. If you are not on 64-bit Windows, you just need to set up a Rust environment to compile the codes on your own.
